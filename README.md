# `BRRR`

### Let Gucci Mane tell you when your script is done.


Have you ever wanted to know - and celebrate - when your simulations are
finally done running in Python? Have you ever been so proud of pulling of a
tricky bit of code that you wanted Flavor Flav to yell "yeaaahhhh,
boi!!" as soon as it successfully completes? Have you ever gotten an
error message that felt like DJ Khaled yelling, "They don't wanna see us
win!"

Probably not, but you might now. And now, with BRRR, you can.

Installation
------------

`BRRR` is available on Github and can be installed ...:



Requirements
------------

If you're on a Mac, `BRRR` relies on you having the `afplay` utility installed
and on the PATH.

If you're on Linux `BRRR` relies on you having the `aplay` utility from the ALSA
system installed and on the PATH.

If you are using Windows, you're shit out of luck. Just kidding, the audio
player associated with .wav files on your system will be used.

Details
-------

Inspired by and building from Brooke Watson's magnificent
[`BRRR`](https://github.com/brooke-watson/BRRR/) package, BRRR has one
function - `skrrrahh()`, which plays a rap adlib when it is called. It
is useful if you have a script that takes a while to run, and want to be
notified when it is finished. The package currently
includes 51 different sounds from 34 artists, the majority of which are pulled from [The Rap Board](therapboard.com) by [LP
Riel](http://www.lpriel.com/).

The default sound is, appropriately, "BRRR", by Gucci Mane. The package also features two other iconic Guwop sounds: "'S GUCCI" (`skrrrahh(25)`) and "YEAAAHHH" (`skrrrahh(27)`). Gucci's glow up is a daily inspiration in 2017, and BRRR would not be icey without him.

(`skrrrahh()` is spelled with three R's and two H's, according to the
canonical [Genius.com](https://genius.com/12737380). Just like Brooke, I will not budge on
this.)


### Usage

```
skrrrahh(sound = 26)
skrrrahh()
skrrrahh(0)
skrrrahh("snoop")`
skrrrahh(41)
```

### Arguments

`sound` character string or number specifying what sound to be played by
either specifying one of the built in sounds or specifying the path to a
wav file. The default is 1. Possible sounds are:

    ##  [1] "twochainz"  "twochainz1" "bigboi"     "biggie"     "bigsean"   
    ##  [6] "bigsean1"   "bigsean2"   "bigsean3"   "bigsean4"   "bigsean5"  
    ## [11] "bigshaq"    "birdman"    "birdman1"   "birdman2"   "busta"     
    ## [16] "chance"     "desiigner"  "diddy"      "drake"      "drake1"    
    ## [21] "drummaboy"  "fetty"      "flava"      "future"     "gucci"     
    ## [26] "gucci1"     "gucci2"     "jayz"       "jayz1.wav"  "kendrick"  
    ## [31] "khaled"     "khaled1"    "khaled2"    "khaled3"    "liljon"    
    ## [36] "liljon1"    "nicki"      "pitbull"    "ross"       "ross1"     
    ## [41] "schoolboy"  "snoop"      "soulja"     "takeoff"    "tpain.wav"
    ## [46] "traviscott" "treysongz"  "trick"      "waka"       "weezy"     
    ## [51] "yg"

If `sound` does not match any of the sounds above, a number between 1 and 51, or a valid `http` path to a `.wav` file, a
random sound will be played.

### Examples

    # Play a random rap adlib.

    # Change your options to have DJ Khaled console you everytime you hit an error
    # message.
    options(error = function() {skrrrahh(33)})

    # The ting goes:
    skrrrahh(11)
